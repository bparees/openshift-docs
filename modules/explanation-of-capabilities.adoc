= Explanation of features provided by optional capabilities

{product-title} {product-version} defines 3 capabilities which can be disabled at install time, or enabled at anytime after installation.  The following summarizes what functionality is provided with each capability.

== Samples

The `openshift-samples` capability enables the xref:../openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.adoc#configuring-samples-operator[Samples Operator] which provides sample content for the cluster.  The sample content includes `ImageStreamTags` referencing example images that can be used to build applications and deploy databases.  It also includes `Templates` which can be deployed to quickly provide an example running application or be customized for more specific usage.

These ImageStreamTags and Templates can be found in the `openshift` namespace on the cluster, when this capability is enabled.

== BareMetal

The `baremetal` capability enables the xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.adoc#ipi-install[Bare Metal Operator] which enables management of baremetal machines to be used as nodes in the cluster.  This operator is unnecessary when running clusters on platforms other than baremetal.

== Marketplace

The `marketplace` capability enables the xref:../operators/understanding/olm-rh-catalogs.adoc#olm-rh-catalogs[Marketplace Operator] which allows for easy enablement of a set of default Operator Lifecycle Manager catalogs on the cluster.  If this capability is disabled, the catalogs can still be configured and managed on the cluster manually.  If enabled, the individual catalogs can be enabled/disabled by configuring the Marketplace Operator.
